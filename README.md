## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was a good layout practice for me. I was going through some newbie challenges on frontend mentor and they suggested this is good for first timers. I do feel like I should have done this challenge before.

This was a fairly simple layout and not much css has been used so I felt like using custom properties will be unnecassary hence I did not used them in this project.
